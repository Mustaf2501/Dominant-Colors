# Dominant-Colors

k-means clustering:

k-means clustering is a classical clustering algorithm that uses an expectation maximization like technique to partition a number of data  points in this case (r,g,b) tuples, into k clusters. 

The goal of this project was to implement this machine learning algorithm to find the dominant colors within an image and output them in their respective hexadecimal values.
