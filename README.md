# Dominant-Colors

k-means clustering:

k-means clustering is a classical clustering algorithm that uses an expectation maximization like technique to partition a number of data  points ,in this case a series of tuples (r,b,g), into k clusters. 

The goal of this project was to implement this machine learning algorithm to find the dominant colors within an image and output them in their respective hexadecimal values.
